    <h1>Observations and Measurements</h1>
    
    <p>Obme is a prototype data system for capturing observations and measurements of the world in a way that makes finding data and integrating easier for the everyday researcher or research group.  The system has been designed with ecology in mind (in particular trait-based ecology), but can be used anywhere in which entities are observed and traits of these entities are measured.  The key distinction between Obme and the typical way that people capture real world data is that trait-entity relationships and observation context are made explicit.  These are the ingredients that make sense of within-dataset data (i.e., metadata about values).  Obme does not focus on metadata at the level of the dataset, because other systems and models are already capturing this well.</p>
    <p>Obme is a database realisation of the Observation and Measurement Onology (OBOE) developed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.</p>

    <div class="list-group">

        <span class="badge">1</span>
        Measurement instances are not yet tied to a resource, which is a person, paper, instrument, etc. that observed an entity and measured a trait.</p>
        <p class="list-group-item">
          <span class="badge">2</span>
          Make sure observations and measurements line up properly when displaying data. [This is fixed although in a way that might slow things down for larger datasets...]</p>
